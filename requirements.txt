The goal of the notebook is to perform an analysis of obesity data, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, with the end goal of predicting obesity levels.
Python Libraries Used:
Data manipulation and analysis:
pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly working with DataFrames.
numpy: Used for numerical computations.
Data preprocessing and feature scaling:
sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler: Used for standardizing numerical features.
sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder: although it's imported, it is not explicitly used in the provided code.
Model training and evaluation:
sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split: Used for splitting the data into training and testing sets.
sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression: Used for building a logistic regression model.
sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier: although it's imported, it is not explicitly used in the provided code.
sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score: Used for calculating the accuracy of the model.
sklearn.metrics.classification_report: Used for generating a classification report with precision, recall, F1-score, and support.
sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix: Used for generating confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the model.
Visualization:
matplotlib.pyplot: Used for creating plots and visualizations.
seaborn: Used for creating more advanced statistical visualizations.
Saving the model:
joblib: although it's imported, it is not explicitly used in the provided code.
Google Colab Specific:
google.colab: Used for file uploading within the Colab environment.
